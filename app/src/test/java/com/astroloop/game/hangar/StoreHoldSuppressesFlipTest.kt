/**
 * Drives the real touch-handling production code — `purchaseHeldUpgrade` and `handleStoreTap` —
 * rather than poking `HangarState` directly (`StoreTapFlipTest`'s approach), so this is the test
 * that would have caught the flip-after-purchase bug: a completed hold buys a level and leaves
 * the finger down, so the release that follows falls through to `handleTap` → `handleStoreTap`
 * on the very tile that was just bought.
 *
 * What this does NOT cover: full `MotionEvent` dispatch through `onTouchEvent` — `ACTION_DOWN`
 * tile resolution, the 15f slop cancel, and `ACTION_UP`'s dispatch into `handleTap`. Those all
 * resolve tiles against `renderer.upgradeRects`, which `StorePageRenderer.draw()` only populates
 * from inside a live Canvas pass, and `HangarSurfaceView.render()` gets that Canvas from
 * `holder.lockCanvas()` — there is no valid `Surface` to draw into under Robolectric (same as on
 * a real device before the surface is ready), so that call returns null and no draw ever runs.
 * Injecting a throwaway `RectF` into `upgradeRects` and calling the two handlers directly is the
 * highest seam available that still runs the actual suppression decision rather than a
 * reimplementation of it. The `ACTION_DOWN`/`ACTION_MOVE`/`ACTION_UP` wiring itself remains
 * verified only by code trace and a device check — see the Task 5 fix report.
