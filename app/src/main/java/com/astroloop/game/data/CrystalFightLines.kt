     * stopping. His silence is the refusal — and it makes his first word in the ghost phase land.

     *    "STAY" on the line immediately before it: *you never had to stay*.
     *  - The crew ASK to be released ("Let go, boss.") before Astro grants it.
     *
     * Every pronoun resolves against the line directly before it: the radio HUD shows ONE line at
     * a time with no scrollback, so a pronoun needing earlier context is unreadable.
